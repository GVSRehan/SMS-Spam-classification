# SMS-Spam-classification
SMS Spam Classification Project
This repository is dedicated to a comprehensive SMS spam classification project leveraging machine learning techniques. The project aims to develop robust models capable of accurately detecting spam messages in SMS conversations.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: The SMS data undergoes meticulous preprocessing, including text normalization, removal of special characters, and stopwords elimination, to prepare it for model training.
Model Training: Various classification algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and others, are trained on the preprocessed SMS data to learn patterns indicative of spam messages.
Model Evaluation: The trained models are rigorously evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to assess their efficacy in distinguishing between spam and legitimate messages.
Dataset: The project utilizes a dataset containing a collection of SMS messages labeled as spam or non-spam (ham), facilitating supervised learning for model development.
Usage:
Clone the Repository: Clone or download the repository to your local machine to access the project files.
Install Dependencies: Ensure that the necessary dependencies, including Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and NLTK, are installed in your environment.
